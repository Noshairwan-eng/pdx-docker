“Substitution code” and what each substitution code means?</h3>
<p class="MsoNormal">Parts can be substituted in the place of one another; this 
defines part to be allocated against requested part. There can have two options 
whether a part is compatible with its previous part or not. If it is compatible 
with its previous part then its interchangeable code will be “018” and if it is 
not then its interchangeable code will be “016”. Substitution can be made on the 
basis of availability and compatibility. There are four options/techniques to 
substitute parts:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 5pt"></span> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 36pt; TEXT-INDENT: -18pt; tab-stops: 36.0pt">1.  
<b>Substitution code 0</b>: Allocate stock from older parts first then newer 
parts but keeping in view their interchangeable codes.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 36pt; TEXT-INDENT: -18pt; tab-stops: 36.0pt">2.  
<b>Substitution code 1</b>: In this allocation technique if requested quantity 
is fulfilled from requested part then requested part should be supplied. If 
requested quantity is not fulfilled from requested part then latest part should 
be supplied even there is a few stock available against requested part. (Partial 
stock will not be allocated). If latest part doesn’t have enough stock available 
then latest part will be unprocessed.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 36pt; TEXT-INDENT: -18pt; tab-stops: 36.0pt">3.  
<b>Substitution code 2</b>: In this allocation method always requested part is 
supplied. If no stock is available against requested part then requested part 
will be marked as unprocessed.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 36pt; TEXT-INDENT: -18pt; tab-stops: 36.0pt">4.  
<b>Substitution code 3</b>: In this allocation method always latest part is 
supplied even there is stock available against old parts in chain and part is 
compatible with older parts. If latest part doesn’t have enough stock available 
then latest part will be unprocessed. By default substitution code “0” is 
selected in quotation condition.</p>
