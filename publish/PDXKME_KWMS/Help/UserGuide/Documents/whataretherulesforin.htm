<h3 style="MARGIN-LEFT: 45pt; TEXT-INDENT: -45pt; tab-stops: 45.0pt">What are 
the rules for interchangeability?</h3>
<p class="MsoNormal">There are some conditions by which interchangeability is 
performed against requested part.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 36pt; TEXT-INDENT: -18pt; tab-stops: 36.0pt">1.  First 
and most important condition is that part should be a chained part.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 36pt; TEXT-INDENT: -18pt; tab-stops: 36.0pt">2.  If 
requested part has interchangeable code “016” then it will not be substituted 
with older parts.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 36pt; TEXT-INDENT: -18pt; tab-stops: 36.0pt">3.  If 
requested part has interchangeable code “018” then it can be substituted by its 
immediate old part and then Parts System will see old parts substitution code if 
that is again “018” then it means requested part can be substituted from one 
more older part and so on until a “016” coded interchangeable part is reached or 
chain ends.  </p>
