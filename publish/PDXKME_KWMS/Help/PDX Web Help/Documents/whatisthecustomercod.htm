Customer code? What is its purpose?</h3>
<p class="MsoNormal">One distributor could possibly have multiple shipping 
addresses or multiple billing rates for different branches. To accommodate this 
PDX provides customer codes. One distributor can have multiple customer codes 
which help distributors to manage orders for their all branches with common 
login credentials. Moreover this also help customers to manage different billing 
rates with same distributor code.</p>
